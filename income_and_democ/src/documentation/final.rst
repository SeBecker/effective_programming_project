    Some of these steps seem to fail on Linux because apparently Stata is not capable of saving png-figures in batch mode. Just do a search for "png" in the *src/final* directory and replace all occurences by "eps". Make sure that you allow LaTeX to call external commands (shell escape needs to be enabled).
